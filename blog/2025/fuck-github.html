         <h1 class="ptitle">Fuck Github, hello Codeberg</h1>
         <time>12rd of August, 2025</time>
<p>Been a long time since I’ve written a post on the blog, aye? Well,
there’s a reason for that: I am <strong>way</strong> too lazy. I’ve
started writing some posts about different themes but haven’t finished
any single one.</p>
<p>I know this blog has accidentally been about a web journal with
future plans that haven’t been finished. But hear me out on this
one.</p>
<p>I’m remaking the website for the third time, now it will hopefully be
flexible enough to allow for me to use different templates depending if
I want the sidebar on one side, the other one or no sidebar at all; all
while allowing me to display custom per-page content so I can link to a
different language version of the page.</p>
<p>But you ghost reader may be wondering, why that title? Heh, due to
growing concerns about Github’s leadership, I’ve decided to move to
codeberg. Here’s a simple table so you quickly catch up.</p>
<table style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">Github</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Codeberg</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">Shoves copilot AI</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Has no AI</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center;">Has some trackers</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Does not track you</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">It’s proprietary software itself</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">It’s free software itself</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center;">Owned by Microsoft</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Not-for-profit business</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>My main concerns are specially the AI stuff, microsoft’s ownership of
the platform and the fact that it’s proprietary itself.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Github is still a good platform, hell, you are
reading this because it’s hosted <em>for now</em> on Github pages. But
not for long.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you may use what it feels right, there’s no
denying that, and probably I’m going schitzo with paranoia, but I’d
rather use a service that <strong>is</strong> free software in itself
and not to use any microsoft stuff.</p>
<p>Since I’m going to remake the website (for the third time lmao) I
decided to publish it on codeberg instead since the pages services is
all I need. Sure, the repository’s size limit may be 750Mb, but my
website weights around 15Mb at the time of writing this. But come on,
text takes next to no space, the heaviest things will be media files and
turns out that .webp and .webm files are lighter than .png or .mp4
files. So in my case is totally fine.</p>
<p>This was just a quick post I decided to write on the spot. I
literally discovered codeberg scrolling trough my Mastodon feed (<a
href="https://www.mastodon.social/@juangames">follow me</a> in there
btw) and just made my account.</p>
<p>I managed to set up a custom domain for it and for now it works, if
you want to check the progress you can <a
href="https://test.juangames.com">check in here</a>, but for now there’s
nothing. I may change the domain to juangames.net, but I’m still not
sure about it. Probably once I’m done rebuilding the site from
scratch.</p>
