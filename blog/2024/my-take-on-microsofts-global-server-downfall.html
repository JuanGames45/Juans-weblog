	<h1 class="ptitle">My take on microsoft's global server downfall</h1>

	<time>19th of July 2024, 11:30am</time>
	 
<p>Not gonna lie, this was really surprising to hear. I was chilling when
   a relative called me telling that Microsoft is down in all the country and
   that this affected airports (atleast here in spain).</p>

   <p>She didn't tell me much since she's not into the tech world like me
   and oveheard it in the radio, just called me because it may interested me.
   </p>

   <p>Boy it did, I started to investigate and found out that the mainly
   affected services are Microsoft Azure (a cloud service they have) and 
   the microsoft 365 office suit, also on the cloud.</p>

   <p>One think I fully learnt today is not to look at the news on social
   media. Check websites you trust or do RSS, because it's full of bots and
   missinformation.<br>
   I don't say blogs won't be like that, but there isn't a shit ton of people
   doing the same joke over and over again to try to get a bit of attention.
   </p>

   <p>Once my search concluded (which was a quick search on brave reading 
   some news articles and looking at downdetector), I discovered that it was
   a failed update on their cloud system and their "antivirus" detected 
   their own programs as a menace to the system.</p>

   <p>This reminds me of a message I recieved from a friend, who has way more
   experience and knowledge than me, that said:<br>
   <em>according to what the comment say, Microsoft has launched a "failed"
   update that "fucks up" the windows 11's bootloader that makes the death
   screen pop up at the 6th-7th second after booting up the computer</em></p>

   <p>It's a coincidence way too big to let it pass just like that. It may be
   my brain trying to make connections to unrelated stuff, but both a cloud
   fall and windows hang up? No way. Tho I haven't seen any case, so take this
   last one as a rumor.</p>

   <p>Going to the consecuences, it left a lot of companies unable to work.
   Here in spain, it affected airlines like Iberia, Ryanair, companies like
   Repsol, and even the fucking town hall of Madrid.<br>
   Tho knowing that they pay a lot of money so in case of a system fail they
   can blame microsoft (they told me that one time I went to a trip from the
   highschool, I need to write about that) it's no surprise they are affected
   as well.</p>

   <p>Now, do you guys see normal that half the country is unable to work
   because of the incompetence of a single company? This is why a monopoly is
   so dangerous. Our whole future is in the hands of a few people unless we
   do something to change that asap.</p>

   <p>I don't say you <b>need</b> to leave windows now and switch over to
   GNU/Linux (despite heavily encouraging it). At the end of the day, a lot
   of people develop software only for windows because of the huge marketshare
   they hold, everyone is familiar with windows. The problem is, that we are
   dependent on a company that tries to do <b>anything</b> on their power to
   be the only company in charge of our technology and we can't even trust on
   if their software is doing exactly what they say it's doing.<p>

   <p>People deserve, no, they <b>have the right to choose what they use</b>.
   If you want to use Windows, or mac; office or libreoffice; photoshop or
   GIMP; whatsapp or telegram... People should use them because they 
   <b><em>choose</em></b> to, not because a big company forces them to.</p>

   <p>Now the internet is only five sites and if one falls, everything
   crumbles. I understand we as humans make mistakes, <em>Errare humanum 
   est</em>, but this is ridiculous</p>

   <p>To conclude with this post I want to say two things:</p>
   <ol>
   <li>You people have the right to use whatever you want, being open source
   or not, but it's unacceptable that we are forced to use certain services
   because other than you decided to.</li>

   <li>We shouldn't depend on a single company, cuz if they mess up, everything
   falls appart. I understand that we as humans depend on and help each other 
   to survive, that's how we evolved. But we can't be depending on a company
   for us to work or basically do anything</li>
   </ol>

   <p>Sorry if this post looks a little rushed, it's because it is. I wanted
   to share my thoughts on this matter asap. I want to work on this website
   since I think I have a clear vission on how to do it.</p>

   <p>Once I port this document to my computer (I'm writting this on the
   msdos thinkpad) I'll publish this entry both on my website, newgrounds and
   spacehey. And then I'll start writting a post about all the new ideas I
   have for this site, so stay tuned!</p>
