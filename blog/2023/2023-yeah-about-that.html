            <p>I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea on how to start this blog post, the proof being that I took a whole
                 damm week to even start writing this. Hell, I'm finishing this on a February 15th.</p>
            
            <p>I feel like I have this blog a little abandoned, and kinda lost some motivation to keep improving it.
                Months ago, I promised I would do a couple of things like redrawing the banner, changing the
                comment system etc.
            </p>
            
            <p>But I ended up forgetting about it and procrastinated with this post</p>
    
            <p>This project started by the end of the year 2021, when the idea struck on my mind after I saw an artist's
                blog made in blogger. I liked the concept of a website of my own whwere I could do stuff just like people
                used to in the early 2000's.
            </p>
    
            <p> So in January 2nd of 2022 I published a journal entry on my <a href="https://juangames45.deviantart.com">Deviantart account</a>, 
                expressing the idea
                of making the website. Then I started working on it with Wix, uploading posts in there, DA and 
                <a href="https://juangames45.newgrounds.com">newgrounds</a>.
            </p>
    
            <p> But Wix was... Bad, to say the least, at least for my objective. I even bought the premium package, but I luckily
                was able to get a refund, and instead that money wennt to hostinger (my current server provider) which I'm really
                happy with.
            </p>
    
            <p>Now that I had the website built in wordpress, I stopped writing posts on social media to do it here, doung the
                monthly update each (forgive my redundancy) month.
            </p>
    
            <p>But I felt really unmotivated to keep doing those due lazyness and a lack of actual news to share.
                <br>
                And in top of the list, I have a lot of limirarions to make the website 100% like I want, with all those 
                "buy this extension" and "Buy the premium pack" bullshit that doesn't eve do what I want.
            </p>
    
            <p>Then... What am I going to do with this project from now on?</p>
    
            <p>Here's the kicker. I want to keep drawing and photography as a pure hobby, because I want to be a programmer as a
                full-time job. So I basically said "Fuck it" and started coding a website from scratch.
            </p>
    
            <p>Although it started looking like this:</p>
            <img src="https://www.juangames.com/media/images/web-screenshot1.png" width="98%">
            <p id="img_comment">Pic taken on jan 25th, I only knew html at the time.</p>
    
            <p>And at the time it looks like this:</p>
            <img src="https://www.juangames.com/media/images/web-screenshot2.png" width="98%">
            <p id="img_comment">Pic taken on Feb 15th, now with a bit of CSS knowledge.</p>
    
            <p>So yeah, this means a whole bunch of changes.</p>
    
            <p>The first one being that I'm going to stop with the monthly updates. I struggled keeping up because I had no actual
                news, and I hate publishing short posts of a few words (probably OCD lmao), so instead of actually publishing updates
                each month, I'll make them only if I have actual news to avoid this situation.
            </p>
    
            <p>By the way, this website will be deleted soon and replaced with a single image while I develop the new one.
                <br>
                It will be in a week so when I do it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                <img src="https://www.juangames.com/media/images/apache2-bible.png" width="100%">
                </div>
    
                <div class="column">
                    <p height="100%">I don't know exactly how it will look like, but it will be just a simple, single-paged website.
                    Although I'm still learning as you can see in the pic.
                    <br>
                    My goal is to get rid of both wordpress and, when I can, hostinger to use a home-made Apache server.</p>
                    
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> So the only bills I'll have to pay are the domain and the electric bill (screw spain goverment for the increment of 
                the electric bill price btw).
            </p>
    
            <p>I recently learnt that php id based post are the best option for new entries. the only thing being that instead of 
                "www.juangames.com/(lable)/(year)/(post name)", you'll probably see "www.juangames.com/post.php?id=x".
             <br>
             But hey, that's better than having every single post in a separated html document that may be obsolete over time.
             </p>
    
            <p>So that's why I want to try doing that, I would be 100% in control of my website, the data and what I do with it.
                <br>
                It'll be a tough task, but over time I think it will worth it.
            </p>
    
            <p>This is Juan Games, and I'll see you in my next website, cya. (^_^) /</p>
