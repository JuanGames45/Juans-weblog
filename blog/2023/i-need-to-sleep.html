         <h1 id="ptitle">I need to sleep.</h1>
         <time datetime="24/08/2023">24th of August, 2023</time>
 
         <p>To be honest, I don't even know where to start with this.
             <br>
             As y'all may know sleep is <b>essential</b> to be a functionally capable human being,
             without it, we wouldn't have the rest we need to regenerate our sanity.
         </p>
         <p>"But wait, why are you suddenly talking about sleep if this is your personal blog no one
             even reads?" you may ask. The answer is simple, I fucked up my sleep schedule, sleeping
             on the day and being awake during night time.
         </p>
 
         <p>And again you may ask, "but it's summer, it souldn't matter". And here's the answer to that
             question imaginary asker, because unless you have a nightime work, you kinda feel like shit.
             <br>
             Not in a "I'm so tired" mood (which is also applied), but in a psicological way, you feel like you
             missed the entire day, like you've done nothing and feel guilty about it, just waiting until
             you're tired enought to sleep.
         </p>
 
         <p>And I say this by my personal experienece with this issue, in fact, I'm writing this after waking up
             at 4pm the previous day, being at the time of writing this 20 hours awake without sleeping, just to
             try to fix this.
         </p>
 
         <p>Atleast with the laptop I could play videogames or working on this site, but with my laptop gone 
             (it fell off and I'll have it repaired tomorrow) I could do absolutely nothing, just watching youtube,
             killing time, waiting with no objective, and that's no good. 
             <br>
             And in fact, if this goes by a long time, it
             can cause a serious depression.
         </p>
 
         <p>Luckily I haven't gotten to that point, and pardon my french, but that would be really fucked up to deal with.
         </p>
 
         <p>You see, the brain is an organ like any other, it needs mantaining, if you don't take care properly of it,
             you would literally go crazy. I'm not a scientist nor a medic, but I can tell, you get way more rest in night time
             than in daytime. I don't even know how I have the strengh to write this, I just feel too tired even tho I drinked
             two cups of coffee.
         </p>
         <p>I know this isn't my usual content, but a vent post? IDK. I just hope that anyone who reads this
             gets the idea, you need to sleep properly at a right schedule if you want to keep a good mental (and fisical) health.
         </p>
         <p>Thank you for sticking out this long, I honestly needed to get that out of my chest. I'll see y'all in my next post, 
             cya!</p>
