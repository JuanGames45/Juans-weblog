         <h1>Legal stuff</h1>

            <p>Self explanatory, all legal stuff goes here. This includes this site's copyleft and third party credits.</p>

            <h2 id="copyleft">Copyleft</h2>

            <p>You can read <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank">this article</a> from the GNU
            website for more information. But in short is a licensing concept that allows you to do whatever tf you want
            with a work as long as you redistribute it with the same license.
            </p>

            <p>Thus, this entire website is under the
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" type="_blank">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> license (Creative Commons
            attribution-sharealike 4.0), the content (blogposts, pages etc) is under the
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/" type="blank">CC BY-ND 4.0</a> license (Creative Commons
            attribution-noderivatives) unless it's explicily stated otherwise.<br>
            However, the javascript is licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</a> Affero General 
            Public License. Why? You may ask, well, I couldn't find the magnent links for the CC license and make it so the 
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> detected it as free javascript, so after some testing 
            I managed to make it work with the AGPL (keep in mind that atm I'm still a novice). I don't mind since it's a
            free software license after all, but if it doesn't make sense from a legal perspective, please 
            <a href="https://www.juangames.com/about/contact">contact me</a> to solve it.</p>

            <p>Why these license? You may be asking. Well, I ain't no lawyer but after some investigation, I think it's best to apply
                a copyleft license to the website itself and a media license to the content respectively.

            <h2>Third party credits & fonts</h2>

            <p>All images that are not mine/made by me belong to their respective owners.</p>


            <p>Fonts used are the <a href="https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts" target="_blank">
                Liberation font family</a>.
            Specifically Liberattion Sans for the regular text and Liberation Mono for monospace.</p>

            <p>This website is fully hosted in <a href="https://github.com/JuanGames45/Juans-weblog">GitHub</a> using their 
                <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> service.</p>

            <p>Search bar works using <a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com">Duckduckgo</a> services. It's basically an
            html form set to browse in duckduckgo with a filter so it only shows results of this website. I got the idea from
            Justin Hall's website <a href="https://www.links.net">Links.net</a>, which is basically the same thing but with http google.</p>
