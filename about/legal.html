         <h1>Legal stuff</h1>

            <p>Self explanatory, all legal stuff goes here. This includes this site's copyleft and third party credits.</p>

            <h2 id="copyleft">Copyleft</h2>

            <p>You can read <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank">this article</a> from the GNU
            website for more information. But in short is a licensing concept that allows you to do whatever tf you want
            with a work as long as you redistribute it with the same license.
            </p>

            <p>Thus, this entire website is under the

            attribution-sharealike 4.0) and the content (blogposts, pages etc) is under the

            attribution-noderivatives) unless it's explicily stated otherwise.</p>

            <p>Why these license? You may be asking. Well, I ain't no lawyer but after some investigation, I think it's best to apply
                a copyleft license to the website itself and a media license to the content respectively.
