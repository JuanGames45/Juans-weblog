            <time>10th of February 2025 7:00pm</time>

		 <p>Hey there, it's been a dog's age since my last post :V</p>
	 
	<p>I'm writting this because of a bad experience I recently had with a 2nd hand book store, where I felt
	 extorted into paying with my debit card instead of actual cash.</p>
	
	 <p>I apologise in advance if you feel that this post is mainly me ranting about this, but I really wanted
	 to share this story.</p>

	 <p>It all started a few days ago when I went to a second hand store. I wanted to buy a book for my
	 mom as a gift and I had no clue on what to give to her, so I wanted to pick one of the "surprise"
	 books, which is basically, you pay 5 bucks and you get a random book. It's gambling on books, I know,
	 but that's the fun part...

	    my previous post</a>, here's the post where I would write about all the exciting ideas I 
    	have for this blog.<br>
	    I've tried some of them and, while they failed, I think others will be great for this blog!...

            <time>19th of July 2024, 11:30am</time>

	   <p>Not gonna lie, this was really surprising to hear. I was chilling when
	   a relative called me telling that Microsoft is down in all the country and
	   that this affected airports (atleast here in spain)...
