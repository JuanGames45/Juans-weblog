        I doubt anyone would actually want to read any of these but here they are :V</p>

        <p>This is still under construction, I'm trying to figure out a way to organise them in cathegories.<br>
            Keep in mind that this is a static website, I have to type <b>everything</b> manually in html.

            <time>12rd of August, 2025</time>
            <p>Been a long time since I’ve written a post on the blog, aye? Well,
            there’s a reason for that: I am <strong>way</strong> too lazy. I’ve
            started writing some posts about different themes but haven’t finished
            any single one.</p>
            <p>I know this blog has accidentally been about a web journal with
            future plans that haven’t been finished. But hear me out on this
            one...</p>

            <time>10th of February 2025 7:00pm</time>

		 <p>Hey there, it's been a dog's age since my last post :V</p>
	 
	<p>I'm writting this because of a bad experience I recently had with a 2nd hand book store, where I felt
	 extorted into paying with my debit card instead of actual cash.</p>
	
	 <p>I apologise in advance if you feel that this post is mainly me ranting about this, but I really wanted
	 to share this story.</p>

	 <p>It all started a few days ago when I went to a second hand store. I wanted to buy a book for my
	 mom as a gift and I had no clue on what to give to her, so I wanted to pick one of the "surprise"
	 books, which is basically, you pay 5 bucks and you get a random book. It's gambling on books, I know,
	 but that's the fun part...

	    my previous post</a>, here's the post where I would write about all the exciting ideas I 
    	have for this blog.<br>
	    I've tried some of them and, while they failed, I think others will be great for this blog!...

            <time>19th of July 2024, 11:30am</time>

            <p>Not gonna lie, this was really surprising to hear. I was chilling when
            a relative called me telling that Microsoft is down in all the country and
            that this affected airports (atleast here in spain)...</p>

         <time datetime="24/08/2023">24th of August, 2023</time>
 
         <p>To be honest, I don't even know where to start with this.
             <br>
             As y'all may know sleep is <b>essential</b> to be a functionally capable human being,
             without it, we wouldn't have the rest we need to regenerate our sanity.
         </p>
         <p>"But wait, why are you suddenly talking about sleep if this is your personal blog no one
             even reads?" you may ask. The answer is simple, I fucked up my sleep schedule, sleeping
             on the day and being awake during night time...

            <p>I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea on how to start this blog post, the proof being that I took a whole
                 damm week to even start writing this. Hell, I'm finishing this on a February 15th.</p>
            
            <p>I feel like I have this blog a little abandoned, and kinda lost some motivation to keep improving it.
                Months ago, I promised I would do a couple of things like redrawing the banner, changing the
                comment system etc...
